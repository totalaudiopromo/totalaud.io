## What This Document Is

A conceptual definition of **Track Memory** — a continuity system for musical works over time.

Not a feature spec. Not a schema design. Not a UI mockup.

Just: what this should feel like, and what it must not become.

## Part 1: The Core Memory Problem

### What Artists Forget, Lose, or Repeat

When artists manage multiple tracks over time, they experience:

**1. Emotional Fatigue**

> "I've explained this track so many times. To my producer. To the label. To the playlist curator. To the journalist. I'm exhausted."

Every explanation is from scratch. There's no cumulative understanding that carries forward.

**2. Context Switching**

> "Wait, which version did I send them? Was it the radio edit? The extended mix? What did I say about it last time?"

Jumping between tracks means rebuilding mental context each time. The work doesn't remember itself.

**3. Re-explaining the Same Thing**

> "I know I described the emotional core of this track somewhere. Was it in an email? A pitch? A message? I can't find it."

Artists write about their work across many places. None of them talk to each other. The same thought is written five times but never consolidated.

**4. Losing Confidence in Older Work**

> "I made that track eighteen months ago. I don't even remember what I was trying to say. Was it any good? Should I still pitch it?"

Returning to old work feels like archaeology. Without memory, artists lose connection to their own intentions.

**5. Scattered Decisions**

> "Did I decide to pitch this to radio? Did I already send it to that blog? What was the feedback?"

Decisions about a track are spread across emails, conversations, notes. There's no single place that knows what happened.

---

### The Pattern

Every time an artist switches to a different track, they must:

1. Remember what it's about
2. Find what they said about it before
3. Reconstruct the context
4. Make decisions again

This is exhausting. It makes prolific artists feel disorganised. It makes careful artists feel overwhelmed.

**The problem is not storage. It's memory.**

---

## Part 2: Track Memory (Not Storage)

### What Track Memory Means

Track Memory is the *accumulated context* of a work over time.

Not just the audio file. Not just metadata. Memory.

**A Track's Memory includes:**

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Intent** | Why it was made. What it was trying to say. The original spark. |
| **Versions** | Which iterations exist. What changed between them. |
| **Notes** | Observations made along the way. First impressions. Reflections. |
| **Story** | The narrative that emerged. How the artist describes it. |
| **Perspectives** | What the system observed. What others said. |
| **Context** | What was happening when it was made. What influenced it. |
| **Decisions** | Choices made. Pitches sent. Responses received. |
| **Timeline** | When things happened. How it unfolded. |

Memory is not just *about* the track. Memory *is* the track.

---

### What Track Memory Is NOT

**It is not a folder.**

Folders are containers. Memory is connective tissue.

**It is not a drive.**

Drives are for storage. Memory is for understanding.

**It is not an asset library.**

Asset libraries manage files by type. Memory manages meaning by work.

**It is not a DAM (Digital Asset Manager).**

DAMs are for teams with production workflows. Memory is for artists with creative journeys.

---

### The Key Distinction

| DAM / Asset Library | Track Memory |
|--------------------|--------------|
| "Where are my files?" | "What do I know about this work?" |
| Organised by type, date, project | Organised by meaning and intention |
| Optimised for retrieval | Optimised for understanding |
| Files are the unit | Works are the unit |
| Browse and filter | Remember and continue |

---

## Part 3: Conceptual Vault Model

### What a "Track" Represents Over Time

A Track is a persistent entity that represents a single musical work.

It is:
- Created when intent is first captured (Ideas → Track)
- Enriched when audio is uploaded (Finish → Track)
- Extended when pitches are written (Pitch → Track)
- Connected when timeline events are added (Timeline → Track)
- Updated when versions are uploaded
- Alive as long as the artist cares about it

A Track is not a file. A Track is a **story that accumulates**.

---

### How Memory Persists (Even When Nothing Is Active)

The Vault holds Tracks.

Each Track holds memory.

When an artist opens the Vault:
- They see their works
- They see the state of each work
- They can return to any work and pick up where they left off

Even if a Track hasn't been touched in 18 months:
- The original intent is still there
- The pitches are still attached
- The timeline events are still visible
- The notes are still readable

Nothing disappears. The work waits.

---

### How This Supports Real Artist Workflows

**Returning After Months**

> "I want to finally release that track I made last year."

Open the Vault. Find the track. See everything:
- What you said about it
- What the system observed
- What you wrote in pitches
- What timeline events you planned

No archaeology. Just pick up.

**Releasing Variants**

> "I want to pitch the instrumental version to a sync library."

Same Track. Different version.
- The core memory is shared
- The variant-specific notes are separate
- The intent carries forward

**Understanding Past Decisions**

> "Did I already send this to that playlist curator?"

Open the Track. See the timeline. See the decisions.
- What was sent, when
- What the response was
- What you noted about it

---

## Part 4: Boundaries & Safety

### What the Vault Must NOT Become

**1. A file manager.**

> "All my audio files in folders."

No. Tracks are not files.

**2. A production tool.**

> "Edit my tracks, add effects, collaborate with others."

No. That's a DAW. This is memory and meaning.

**3. A delivery platform.**

> "Distribute my tracks to Spotify."

No. This is not DistroKid. This is pre-distribution: understanding what to say.

**4. An automation engine.**

> "Automatically send pitches when a track is ready."

No. Artists decide. The system remembers.

**5. A project management tool.**

> "Track tasks, assign deadlines, manage workflows."

No. This is not Asana. This is a calm place to remember.

**6. A social network.**

> "Share tracks, get feedback, build following."

No. This is not SoundCloud. This is private memory.

---

### Why Simplicity Matters

Every feature added to the Vault creates weight.

Artists are already overwhelmed by tools that do too much. Label portals. Playlist submission platforms. Social media managers.

The Vault must be:
- **Calm.** No anxiety. No urgency.
- **Simple.** Few concepts. Deep utility.
- **Trustworthy.** It just remembers. That's all.

---

## Part 5: How This Enables Future Helpers Safely

### The Foundation for Helpers

If a Track has memory, future helpers can read it.

| Helper | What It Could Do (With Memory) |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| Pitch helper | Pre-fill with what you said before |
| Timeline helper | Suggest events based on track state |
| Story helper | Surface key moments to include |
| Reminder helper | Notice tracks that need attention |

Without memory, helpers are guessing. With memory, they're continuing.

---

### Safety Through Memory

Memory makes helpers *safer*:
- They don't invent context — they read it
- They don't assume intent — they recall it
- They don't impose — they suggest based on history

**Memory is the safety layer.**

Automation without memory is dangerous. Automation with memory is assistive.

---

## Part 6: What This Feels Like

### The Artist Experience We're Aiming For

**Before:**
> "I have thirty tracks across five folders. Half of them I don't remember. I have notes somewhere. My pitches are in another app. My timeline is in a spreadsheet. Everything is everywhere."

**After:**
> "I have thirty tracks in my Vault. Each one remembers what it is, what I said, and where it's going. I can pick up any of them and continue. Nothing is lost."

---

### The Feeling

When an artist opens their Vault, they should feel:

> "This is everything I've created. And it all remembers."

Not overwhelmed. Not lost. Not starting fresh.

**Continued.**

---

## Summary

### What Track Memory Is

A living record of a work over time — not just files, but intent, versions, notes, story, context, decisions, and timeline.

### What the Vault Is

A calm place where Tracks live, persist, and remember. A continuity system, not a file manager.

### What It Enables

- Return to old work without reconstruction
- Release variants without re-explaining
- Pitch with accumulated context
- Decide with full history

### What It Must Avoid

- File manager energy
- Production tool scope
- Automation ambition
- Project management complexity
- Social features

### The One Line

> **"This release finally lets me stop juggling folders, notes, and half-remembered decisions."**
