# ✅ Skills Fixed - Ready to Upload!

**Issue:** Skills had incorrect format (wrong filename, missing YAML, backup files)  
**Status:** ✅ **ALL FIXED** - Ready to upload to Claude Desktop  

---

## What Was Wrong (3 Issues)

### Issue 1: Filename Case
- ❌ Wrong: `skill.md` (lowercase)
- ✅ Fixed: `SKILL.md` (uppercase)

### Issue 2: Backup Files
- ❌ Wrong: `SKILL.md` + `SKILL.md.bak` (2 files - rejected by Claude Desktop)
- ✅ Fixed: Only `SKILL.md` (exactly 1 file)

### Issue 3: YAML Frontmatter
- ❌ Initially removed (thought it wasn't needed)
- ✅ Fixed: Added proper YAML frontmatter to all skills

---

## Correct Format (Now Applied to All 12 Skills)

Each .zip file contains **exactly one** `SKILL.md` file:

```markdown
---
name: test-runner
description: Automated test suite execution
---

# Test Runner Skill

Content here...
```
