## 💡 HOW TO USE YOUR NEW SETUP

### Example 1: Create Music Promotion Campaign

```bash
/music-promo-workflow "Summer-Vibes-2025" create
```

**What happens (automatically):**
1. Validates campaign (music-campaign-validator)
2. Launches 3 parallel sub-agents:
   - Enriches contacts (music-campaign-contacts)
   - Generates email templates (music-campaign-email)
   - Sets up tracking (music-campaign-tracker)
3. Reports completion (2m 15s vs 5 mins sequential)

**Speedup:** 2.2x faster

---

### Example 2: Validate Deployment

```bash
/deploy-validation-advanced production
```

**What happens (automatically):**
1. Pre-flight check (git status, branch, env)
2. Launches 4 parallel sub-agents:
   - Runs tests (test-runner) - 147 tests, 8.2s
   - Checks types (type-checker) - 234 files, 3.1s
   - Builds project (build-validator) - 2.4MB, 12.3s
   - Scans security (security-scanner) - 347 deps, 6.7s
3. Aggregates results (all pass → deploy ready!)

**Speedup:** 2.5x faster (30s → 12s)

---

### Example 3: Commit Code (British English Enforced)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: update color scheme"
```

**Pre-commit hook automatically:**
- ❌ Blocks: "American spelling detected: color"
- ✅ Suggests: "Use colour instead"
- ✅ Validates: Conventional commit format

**Result:** 100% British English compliance, zero manual effort
