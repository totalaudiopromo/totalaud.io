## 2025-01-22 - 15:30 - Flow Architect (Stage 1)

### Sub-Agent: Flow Architect
**Task**: Scaffold SharedWorkspace infrastructure
**Files Created**:
- `/apps/aud-web/src/stores/workspaceStore.ts`
- `/apps/aud-web/src/components/SharedWorkspace.tsx`
- `/apps/aud-web/src/components/Workspace/PlanTab.tsx`
- `/apps/aud-web/src/components/Workspace/DoTab.tsx`
- `/apps/aud-web/src/components/Workspace/TrackTab.tsx`
- `/apps/aud-web/src/components/Workspace/LearnTab.tsx`

**Summary**: 
Created unified workspace architecture replacing 5 separate Studio dashboards. Implemented Zustand store with complete data model for releases, campaigns, targets, runs, insights, and metrics. Built SharedWorkspace shell with 4-tab structure (Plan/Do/Track/Learn) and functional tab components with stub implementations. Store includes 30+ actions for CRUD operations, UI state management, and workflow execution routing. All tabs have basic layouts ready for Experience Composer enhancement in Stage 2.

**Key Achievements**:
- ✅ Zustand store with full TypeScript interfaces
- ✅ 4 tab components with routing
- ✅ State persistence for UI preferences
- ✅ Action routing infrastructure (`runAction`)
- ✅ Reactive getters for active campaign/release
- ✅ Layout ready for lens system integration

**Next**: Experience Composer to simplify layouts and ensure usability
