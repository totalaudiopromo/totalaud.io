## Core Principles

### Writing Style
- **Short, confident sentences** - No filler, no cheer
- **UK English spelling** - colour, organise, synchronise, realise
- **Lowercase headings** - Typography rhythm, not shouty capitals
- **No exclamation marks** - Confidence doesn't need emphasis
- **Active voice** - "press start" not "you can press start"
- **Present tense** - "agents running" not "agents are running"

### Word Choices
- **Prefer**: continue, proceed, select, press
- **Avoid**: next, click, tap, awesome, great, nice
- **Replace**: "It looks like..." with direct statements
- **Remove**: "Please", "just", "simply", "easy", "quick"

### Tone Temperature
- **Not**: Playful, American startup, excitable
- **Is**: Measured British creative-tech, studio professional
- **Like**: Ableton Live, Logic Pro, BBC Sounds
- **Not like**: Notion, Slack, Intercom

### Background Tones
- Keep dark mode pure: `#000000` for true black
- Panels: `#0a0a0a` for subtle depth
- Borders: `#1a1a1a` for minimal contrast

---

## Font Pairing Context

### Inter (Sans-serif)
- **Use for**: Body text, buttons, status messages
