**Status**: Archived — January 2026

These documents no longer reflect totalaud.io's product direction.

They are preserved for historical reference and to document the technical exploration that led to the current Vision.

## Why These Were Archived

totalaud.io evolved from an "experimental creative studio" with multi-agent workflows and OS-themed interfaces to a focused **thinking and finishing system** for independent artists.

The archived concepts include:

- **Agent systems** — Multi-agent orchestration, agent personas, agent collaboration
- **OS themes** — ASCII, XP, Aqua, DAW, Analogue visual systems
- **Broker architecture** — Command bridges, personality systems, ambient engines
- **Flow state UI** — Complex dashboard and flow canvas concepts

These were valuable explorations, but they no longer align with the product's purpose: helping artists finish their music, understand what matters, and release with confidence.
