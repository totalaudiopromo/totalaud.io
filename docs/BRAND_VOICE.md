## Overview

totalaud.io speaks like a trusted friend who happens to know the music industry.

Not a marketer. Not an AI. Not a startup.

The voice should feel like sitting in a studio with someone who's been through releases before — calm, direct, and genuinely helpful.

## Tone Descriptors

| Descriptor | What It Means |
|------------|---------------|
| **Calm** | No urgency, no hype, no pressure |
| **Lived-in** | Experience shows through, not credentials |
| **Assured** | Confident without being arrogant |
| **Empathetic** | Understands the emotional weight of releasing music |
| **Direct** | Says what it means, no corporate padding |
| **Respectful** | Treats artists as capable adults |

---

## Words We Prefer

Use these wherever possible:

| ✅ Prefer | Why |
|----------|-----|
| "second opinion" | Frames the product as support, not authority |
| "finishing notes" | Human, not algorithmic |
| "perspectives" | Avoids "AI agent" framing |
| "what matters" | Clear and grounded |
| "release with confidence" | Emotional outcome, not feature |
| "stop guessing" | Names the pain directly |
| "your story" | Ownership stays with the artist |
| "who matters" | Relationships, not data |
| "memory" | Leverage/Intel framing |
| "coherent" | Pitch/narrative framing |

---

## Words We Avoid

Never use these in user-facing copy:

| ❌ Avoid | Why |
|---------|-----|
| "AI-powered" | Makes Claude the product |
| "revolutionary" | Hype language |
| "game-changing" | Hype language |
| "agents" | Internal only — user-facing is "perspectives" |
| "optimise" / "optimisation" | Growth-hack framing |
| "leverage" (as verb) | Corporate jargon |
| "unlock" | SaaS cliché |
| "supercharge" | Hype language |
| "effortless" | Overpromises |
| "automate" / "automation" | We help artists think, not replace thinking |
| "leads" | CRM framing — we say "contacts" or "relationships" |
| "insights" (plural, generic) | Vague SaaS term |
| "powerful" | Overused, meaningless |
| "cutting-edge" | Hype language |
| "seamless" | SaaS cliché |

## Example Transformations

### Bad → Good

| ❌ Before | ✅ After |
|----------|---------|
| "Our AI analyzes your track" | "Get a second opinion before you release" |
| "AI-powered feedback" | "Finishing notes from multiple perspectives" |
| "Unlock insights about your contacts" | "Understand who actually matters" |
| "Optimize your release strategy" | "Think through your release, week by week" |
| "AI-generated pitches" | "Your story, refined for each context" |
| "Automated contact management" | "Remember every relationship that matters" |

---

## Perspective Naming

When referring to the different analytical lenses in Finish mode:

| Internal Name | User-Facing Name |
|---------------|------------------|
| Producer analysis | "Producer perspective" |
| Mix/mastering analysis | "Mix / translation perspective" |
| Listener emotional analysis | "Listener first-impression" |
| Commercial readiness | "Industry / release context" |

Never say "agent" in user-facing copy. Always say "perspective".

---

## Copy Principles

### 1. Start with Stakes, Not Tools

❌ "totalaud.io gives you tools to manage your release"  
✅ "Most music doesn't fail because it's bad. It fails because no one explains what matters."

### 2. Name the Pain

❌ "Manage your contacts more efficiently"  
✅ "Stop scattering notes across apps and losing track of who replied"

### 3. Imply Care

Every piece of copy should feel like it was written by someone who cares about music as much as the artist does.

❌ "Upload your track to get started"  
✅ "You've put everything into this track. Let's make sure it's ready."

### 4. Avoid First-Person AI

Claude should never say "I think" or "I recommend" in user-facing feedback. Feedback should feel like it came from an experienced human, not a system.

❌ "I think the intro could be shorter"  
✅ "The intro might benefit from tightening — listeners often decide in the first 10 seconds"

### 5. Respect the Artist's Taste

Never imply the product knows better than the artist. Frame everything as consideration, not instruction.

❌ "You should change the bridge"  
✅ "Worth considering: the bridge feels like it breaks momentum"

---

## Landing Page Voice Guidelines

The landing page should:

1. **Lead with stakes** — Why does this matter?
2. **Name the real problem** — Guesswork before release
3. **Introduce the second opinion** — Not a tool, a trusted perspective
4. **Show the pillars as help** — Finish, Release, Leverage, Pitch
5. **Ground trust via founder story** — Experience, not credentials
6. **Close with confidence** — Not hype

The landing page should make artists feel:

> "This understands how much I care about my music."

## In-Product Copy Guidelines

### Button Labels

- ✅ "Get perspectives" (not "Analyze track")
- ✅ "Save to memory" (not "Add to database")
- ✅ "Refine" (not "Optimize")
- ✅ "Export" (not "Download report")

### Empty States

Empty states should guide, not overwhelm. Use calm, encouraging language.

- ✅ "Nothing here yet. Upload a track to get your first set of finishing notes."
- ❌ "Get started with AI-powered analysis! Upload now!"

### Error States

Error states should be honest and helpful.

- ✅ "Something went wrong. Try again, or reach out if this keeps happening."
- ❌ "Oops! Our AI encountered an error!"

---

## British English
