# Console Baseline Performance – Post Stage 6.5

**Date**: October 24, 2025
**Status**: Test Suite Infrastructure Complete, Awaiting Database Setup
**Test Framework**: Playwright 1.56.1 + Chromium 141.0.7390.37

---

## Executive Summary

Stage 6.5 browser automation test suite has been successfully built and executed. Test infrastructure is fully functional. Tests encountered expected failures due to Supabase database tables not existing (migration pending application).

**Test Execution Results:**
- **Tests Run**: 22 scenarios
- **Tests Passed**: 0 (database setup required)
- **Tests Failed**: 8 (mission-stack element not found - expected without DB)
- **Tests Skipped**: 14 (dependencies failed)

## Performance Baseline Metrics

### ⏳ Pending - Database Setup Required

The following metrics will be captured once Supabase migration is applied:

| Metric | Target | Status | Measured Value |
|--------|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Realtime Event Latency** | < 250ms | ⏳ Pending | ___ ms |
| **Average FPS During Updates** | >= 55 fps | ⏳ Pending | ___ fps |
| **Form Submit Feedback** | < 100ms | ⏳ Pending | ___ ms |
| **Mode Transition Time** | < 150ms | ⏳ Pending | ___ ms |
| **Insight Generation (Claude API)** | < 3s | ⏳ Pending | ___ s |
| **Metrics Update Animation** | 500ms easeOut | ⏳ Pending | ___ ms |
| **RLS Enforcement** | 100% blocked | ⏳ Pending | ✅/❌ |
| **Memory Footprint** | Baseline | ⏳ Pending | ___ MB |

## Test Suite Status

### Campaign Lifecycle Tests (0/5 Passing)
**Status**: ⏳ Waiting for database setup

| Test | Expected Behavior | Status | Notes |
|------|-------------------|--------|-------|
| Create campaign via Plan form | Submit form, verify localStorage | ❌ Failed | Element not found: mission-stack |
| Persist campaign across refresh | Data restored from localStorage | ❌ Failed | Element not found |
| Switch between mission modes | Smooth transitions < 150ms | ❌ Failed | Element not found |
| Show activity stream | Correct pane layout | ❌ Failed | Element not found |
| Display insight panel metrics | All metrics visible | ❌ Failed | Element not found |

**Root Cause**: `/console` route not rendering `mission-stack` element. Likely due to:
- Supabase campaign tables don't exist
- Authentication flow needs database tables

### Realtime Validation Tests (0/4 Passing)
**Status**: ⏳ Waiting for database setup

| Test | Expected Behavior | Status |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| Stream events to UI < 250ms | Insert via API, measure DOM render | ❌ Skipped |
| Update campaign metrics | Realtime metrics sync | ❌ Skipped |
| Measure FPS during updates | >= 55 fps benchmark | ❌ Skipped |
| Handle event bursts | 20 concurrent events | ❌ Skipped |

**Root Cause**: Requires `campaigns`, `campaign_events`, `campaign_metrics` tables.

### AI Insight Generation Tests (0/6 Passing)
**Status**: ⏳ Waiting for database setup

| Test | Expected Behavior | Status |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| Generate insights via Learn mode | Claude API < 3s | ❌ Skipped |
| Display with trend indicators | ↑ ↓ • icons | ❌ Skipped |
| Show proper card formatting | Styled cards | ❌ Skipped |
| Handle errors gracefully | No uncaught exceptions | ❌ Skipped |
| Display in Insight Panel | Right pane visible | ❌ Skipped |
| Insight quality validation | Accurate data | ❌ Skipped |

**Root Cause**: Requires database tables + sample campaign data.

### Security & RLS Tests (0/8 Passing)
**Status**: ⏳ Waiting for database setup

| Test | Expected Behavior | Status |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| Isolate campaigns between users | User B can't see User A data | ❌ Failed |
| Prevent UI access | Campaign name not visible | ❌ Skipped |
| Block direct API access | 403 or no rows | ❌ Skipped |
| Prevent event reading | Empty results | ❌ Skipped |
| Prevent metrics reading | RLS blocks access | ❌ Skipped |
| Prevent insights reading | Empty array | ❌ Skipped |
| Allow legitimate access | User A sees own data | ❌ Skipped |
| Enforce realtime RLS | No cross-user events | ❌ Skipped |

**Root Cause**: Requires database tables with RLS policies enabled.

---

## Next Steps to Complete Testing

### 1. Apply Supabase Migration
```sql
-- Location: supabase/migrations/20251024000000_add_console_tables.sql
-- Required tables:
- campaigns
- campaign_events
- campaign_metrics
- campaign_insights

-- Apply via Supabase Dashboard or CLI:
supabase db push
```

### 2. Verify RLS Policies
```sql
-- Ensure RLS enabled on all 4 tables
-- Policies should filter by user_id
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename IN ('campaigns', 'campaign_events', 'campaign_metrics', 'campaign_insights');
```

### 3. Re-run Test Suite
```bash
cd /Users/chrisschofield/workspace/active/totalaud.io/apps/aud-web
pnpm test:headed
```

### 4. Capture Baseline Metrics
Once tests pass, document:
- Average latency (ms)
- FPS during updates
- Insight generation time
- Memory footprint
- RLS test results

---

## Baseline Screenshots Captured

Test screenshots are available in `test-results/` directory:

```
test-results/
├── console-campaign-Campaign--1fe8a-eate-campaign-via-Plan-form-chromium/
│   ├── test-failed-1.png
│   └── video.webm
├── console-campaign-Campaign--ce14a-ampaign-across-page-refresh-chromium/
│   ├── test-failed-1.png
│   └── video.webm
└── [additional test results...]
```

These screenshots show the failure state (console not loading due to missing DB tables). After database setup, new baseline screenshots will document the working state.

## Performance Benchmarking Strategy

### When Tests Pass:

#### 1. Latency Measurements
- **Realtime Event Propagation**: Insert event via API → measure time to DOM render
- **Form Submit Feedback**: Button click → "Saved" message appears
- **Mode Transitions**: Click mode button → content renders

#### 2. FPS Monitoring
- **Method**: `requestAnimationFrame` loop counting frames/second
- **Stress Test**: Insert 10 events @ 200ms intervals
- **Target**: >= 55 fps sustained

#### 3. Memory Profiling
- **Tool**: Chrome DevTools Memory profiler
- **Baseline**: Console idle state
- **Under Load**: 20 concurrent event inserts

#### 4. RLS Validation
- **Method**: Create 2 users, User A creates campaign, User B queries
- **Expected**: Empty results for User B (100% isolation)

## Known Issues & Resolutions

### Issue 1: mission-stack Element Not Found
**Status**: Expected - Database not set up
**Resolution**: Apply Supabase migration, re-run tests

### Issue 2: Authentication Flow
**Status**: Tests create users via Supabase auth API
**Resolution**: Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in `.env.local`

### Issue 3: Test Timeout (10s)
**Status**: Page never renders without database
**Resolution**: Database setup will enable page rendering

  - [ ] Insight generation < 3s
  - [ ] RLS 100% enforcement
- [ ] Baseline screenshots saved
- [ ] Memory footprint documented

## Benchmark Comparison Table (For Stage 7)

This table will be used to ensure Stage 7 (Adaptive Theme Framework) does not regress performance:

| Metric | Stage 6 Baseline | Stage 7 Target | Stage 7 Actual | Status |
|--------|------------------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| Realtime Latency | ___ ms | <= Baseline | ___ ms | ⏳ |
| FPS During Updates | ___ fps | >= Baseline | ___ fps | ⏳ |
| Form Feedback | ___ ms | <= Baseline | ___ ms | ⏳ |
| Mode Transition | ___ ms | <= Baseline | ___ ms | ⏳ |
| Insight Generation | ___ s | <= Baseline | ___ s | ⏳ |
| Memory Footprint | ___ MB | <= 110% Baseline | ___ MB | ⏳ |
| RLS Enforcement | ✅/❌ | 100% | ✅/❌ | ⏳ |

**Rule**: Stage 7 theming changes must match or beat Stage 6 baseline performance.
