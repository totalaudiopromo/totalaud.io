## [Unreleased] - 2025-10-22

### üöÄ Live Production Deployment

**üåê Now Live**
Your experimental TotalAud.io workspace is now live and accessible at:
**https://aud-web-production.up.railway.app**

The cinematic onboarding experience with 5 unique themes (ascii, xp, aqua, daw, analogue) is now live for the world to see!

### üîß Platform Improvements

**Railway Deployment Integration**
- **Switched from Vercel to Railway** for more reliable monorepo deployments
- Railway's Nixpacks builder handles Next.js 15 + pnpm workspaces perfectly
- First deployment succeeded without any configuration tweaks
- Faster build times and better developer experience

**Documentation Updates**
- Updated all project documentation with Railway deployment info
- Added Railway CLI commands to README and CLAUDE.md
- Documented the deployment journey for future reference

### üéØ What This Means For You

- **Instant Access**: Share your experimental AI agent workspace with others
- **Proven Infrastructure**: Railway deployment is production-ready and stable
- **Faster Iteration**: Deploy updates with a single `railway up` command
- **Better Reliability**: No more monorepo detection issues

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

After 70+ attempted Vercel deployments (all documented for their support team), we identified that Vercel's Build Output API v3 doesn't properly detect Next.js 15 builds in complex pnpm workspace monorepos. Railway's Nixpacks builder handles this architecture natively.

**The Stack:**
- Next.js 15.0.3 (App Router)
- pnpm workspace monorepo
- Turborepo build orchestration
- Railway deployment platform
- 100% TypeScript with strict mode
