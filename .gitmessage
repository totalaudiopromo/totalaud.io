# Commit Message Template
#
# Format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>
#
# Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
#
# RULES:
# - Use UK spelling (optimise, colour, behaviour, etc.)
# - No emojis
# - Keep titles clear and concise
# - Use lowercase for subject line
# - No period at end of subject
# - Body should explain what and why, not how
#
# Example:
# feat(api): add user authentication
#
# Implemented JWT-based authentication for API routes.
# Users can now register and login with email/password.
