# âœ… YAML Frontmatter Issue - FIXED

**Issue:** All 12 skills had malformed YAML frontmatter  
**Fix:** Removed YAML frontmatter from all skill.md files  
**Status:** âœ… All skills re-packaged and ready to upload  

---

## What Was Wrong

Skills should be **plain markdown** - no YAML frontmatter needed!

**Incorrect (what I accidentally created):**
```markdown
---
name: test-runner
description: Test execution skill
version: 1.0.0
tags: [testing, deployment]
---

# Test Runner Skill
...
```

**Correct (fixed now):**
```markdown
# Test Runner Skill

Automated test suite execution...
```

---

## What I Did to Fix

1. Removed YAML frontmatter from all 12 skill.md files
2. Re-packaged all 12 .zip files in ~/Downloads/
3. Verified all skills are now plain markdown
