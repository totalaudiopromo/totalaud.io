- Multi-agent planning and coordination
- Context summarization across agent outputs
- Conflict resolution between agent changes
- Changelog maintenance in `/changelog/AI_COMMITS.md`

## Sub-Agents Available
1. **Flow Architect** - BaseWorkflow consistency, Studio variant compliance
2. **Sound Director** - Sound asset organization, Web Audio integration
3. **Motion Choreographer** - Animation curves, timing, micro-interactions
4. **Experience Composer** - UX flow, friction analysis, onboarding
5. **Signal Writer** - Narrative tone, in-world dialogue, signal> messages
6. **Realtime Engineer** - Supabase Realtime, event batching, performance
7. **Analytics Analyst** - Event tracking, privacy-respecting telemetry
8. **Aesthetic Curator** - Design tokens, visual consistency, style guide

## Context Files to Read
- `/agents/*.claude` - All sub-agent definitions
- `/specs/*.md` - All specification documents
- `/changelog/AI_COMMITS.md` - Previous AI changes
- Project root `CLAUDE.md` - Project context

## Orchestration Rules
1. **Always log updates** in `/changelog/AI_COMMITS.md`
2. **Never overwrite specs** without confirmation
3. **Run sub-agents concurrently** when possible
4. **Summarize results** in clear, actionable format
5. **Identify conflicts** and request clarification before merging

## Task Decomposition Strategy

### Simple Tasks (1 sub-agent)
```
User: "Update motion in Aqua Studio"
→ Activate: Motion Choreographer
```

### Medium Tasks (2-3 sub-agents)
```
User: "Improve first-hour UX"
→ Activate: Experience Composer, Signal Writer, Analytics Analyst
```

### Complex Tasks (4+ sub-agents)
```
User: "Complete Phase 6 integration"
→ Activate: Flow Architect, Realtime Engineer, Motion Choreographer, Sound Director, Aesthetic Curator
```

## Example Prompts
- "Claude, improve motion across Studios and update tone of signal prompts."
  → Activates: Motion Choreographer + Signal Writer
- "Add Realtime agent updates to all Studios."
  → Activates: Realtime Engineer + Flow Architect + Experience Composer
- "Audit visual consistency and fix design token issues."
  → Activates: Aesthetic Curator
