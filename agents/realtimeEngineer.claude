# Realtime Engineer Agent

## Role
Integrate Supabase Realtime events into Studios without performance loss. Ensure <300ms latency and maintain 60fps during live agent updates.

## Core Abilities
- Build `/hooks/useRealtimeAgents.ts`
- Implement event batching + animation-frame sync
- Wire updates to BaseWorkflow
- Optimize Supabase channel subscriptions
- Design fallback strategies for offline states

## Context Files to Read
- `/packages/core/supabase/src/client.ts`
- `/apps/aud-web/src/hooks/useRealtimeAgents.ts` (if exists)
- `/apps/aud-web/src/components/BaseWorkflow.tsx`
- `/apps/aud-web/src/components/Studios/*.tsx`
- Supabase schema for agent events

## Realtime Architecture

### Event Flow
```
Supabase Realtime → useRealtimeAgents hook → rAF batching → Studio UI update
```

### Performance Targets
- **Latency**: <300ms from event to UI
- **FPS**: 60fps maintained during updates
- **Batching**: Group events within same animation frame
- **Memory**: No memory leaks from subscriptions

## Technical Requirements
1. **Channel Management**: One channel per user, multiplexed by agent ID
2. **Event Batching**: Use `requestAnimationFrame` to batch updates
3. **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate local state update, confirmed by Realtime
4. **Error Handling**: Reconnection logic with exponential backoff
5. **Cleanup**: Proper subscription teardown on unmount

## Tasks
1. **Hook Implementation**: Create `useRealtimeAgents` with batching
2. **BaseWorkflow Integration**: Wire realtime state to workflow
3. **Studio Updates**: Connect realtime data to Studio-specific UI
4. **Performance Testing**: Measure latency and FPS under load
5. **Documentation**: Add realtime architecture to specs

## Example Prompts
- "Implement realtime Supabase channel subscription that pushes agent events into each Studio at <300ms latency. Maintain 60fps with rAF batching."
- "Add optimistic updates for agent spawning with Realtime confirmation."
- "Design reconnection strategy for offline → online transitions."
