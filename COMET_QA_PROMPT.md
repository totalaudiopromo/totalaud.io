# Comet QA Prompt - totalaud.io Visual & Technical Audit

**Project**: totalaud.io - Cinematic AI Agent Workspace for Music Promotion
**Phase**: 10.4 - Post Design System Unification
**Brand Vision**: Professional, calm, creative-tech aesthetic with honest maker tone

---

## üéØ Core Vision & Design Philosophy

### Brand Identity
**totalaud.io** is a cinematic workspace for music promotion powered by AI agents. The aesthetic should feel:
- **Professional but not corporate** - Like a high-end creative tool, not enterprise software
- **Calm and intentional** - Operator ‚Üí Signal journey, not chaotic dashboards
- **Creative-tech fusion** - Music industry meets elegant software design
- **Honest and direct** - No marketing fluff, straight talk to makers

### Visual DNA
- **Colour**: Slate Cyan (#3AA9BE) as the singular accent - professional, calm, creative-tech
- **Background**: Matte Black (#0F1113) - deep charcoal, never pure black
- **Borders**: Sharp 2px borders, zero rounded corners (except intentional exceptions)
- **Typography**: Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for code, EB Garamond for editorial
- **Motion**: 120ms/240ms/400ms/600ms/800ms rhythm - cinematic, never rushed
- **Copy**: Lowercase, British English, honest maker tone - "no campaigns yet ‚Äî start one when you've got a plan"
