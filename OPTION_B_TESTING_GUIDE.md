```

---

### Test 3: Campaign Contacts Skill (10 mins)

**Test 3a: Contact Source Detection**

**In Claude Code, ask:**
```
I have a spreadsheet with 50 radio contacts. How would the music-campaign-contacts skill handle this?
```

**Expected Response:**
Should describe the Intel API enrichment pipeline:
1. Parse CSV/XLSX (name, role, outlet columns)
2. Call Intel API: POST /api/enrich-contacts
3. Validate enrichment success rate (target: 100%)
4. Deduplicate by email address
5. Store in Notion database

**Test 3b: BBC Radio Scraping Pattern**

**In Claude Code, ask:**
```
How would I get all BBC Radio 1 DJ contacts using the music-campaign-contacts skill?
```

**Expected Response:**
Should describe Puppeteer MCP scraping pattern:
1. Navigate to bbc.co.uk/radio1/presenters (Puppeteer MCP)
2. Extract: name, show, email, social media
3. Validate email format (bbc.co.uk domain)
4. Store in Notion with "BBC Radio 1" tag

---

### Test 4: Campaign Email Skill (10 mins)

**Test 4a: Template Type Detection**

**In Claude Code, ask:**
```
What email template type would be best for Pete Tong (BBC Radio 1 DJ)?
```

**Expected Response:**
```
Template Type: DJ/Presenter Template

Characteristics:
- Tone: Friendly, enthusiastic, genuine
- Length: 100-120 words
- Call-to-action: Listen to track, provide feedback
- Focus: Music quality, audience fit

Why this template:
Pete Tong is a DJ/Presenter, not a journalist or curator.
DJ template has highest response rate (33% vs 10-15% for other types).
```

**Test 4b: British English Validation**

**In Claude Code, ask:**
```
Show me an example email template for Pete Tong using music-campaign-email skill. Make sure it uses British English.
```

**Expected Response:**
Should generate a template with British spelling:
- ‚úÖ "favourite" (not "favorite")
- ‚úÖ "Cheers" (British sign-off)
- ‚úÖ "brilliant" (British expression)
- ‚úÖ No American spellings detected

---

### Test 5: Campaign Tracker Skill (10 mins)

**Test 5a: Performance Metrics**

**In Claude Code, ask:**
```
What metrics does the music-campaign-tracker skill monitor?
```

**Expected Response:**
Should list all metrics:

Primary:
- Email open rate (target: 45%+)
- Email response rate (target: 15%+)
- Conversion rate (track played/added) (target: 5%+)
- Time to first response (target: <24 hours)

Secondary:
- Best performing template type
- Best performing contact role
- Response sentiment (positive/neutral/negative)

**Test 5b: Insight Generation**

**In Claude Code, ask:**
```
Give me an example insight the music-campaign-tracker skill would generate if DJ templates are performing better than Journalist templates.
```

**Expected Response:**
Should generate actionable insight like:
```
üí° Insight: Template Performance Gap

DJ template performing 2x better than Journalist template:
- DJ template: 33% response rate
- Journalist template: 15% response rate

Recommendation:
1. Use DJ template format for similar contacts (friendly, music-focused tone)
2. A/B test Journalist template with newsworthy angle emphasis
3. Consider converting journalist contacts to "music writer" framing
```

---

### Test 6: Integration Test (Full Workflow) (15 mins)

**Test 6a: Compositional Workflow Explanation**

**In Claude Code, ask:**
```
Walk me through what happens when I run:
/music-promo-workflow "Summer-Vibes-2025" create
```

**Expected Response:**
Should describe the compositional flow:

```
1. music-campaign-validator skill activates (auto-trigger)
   - Validates campaign name format ‚úì
   - Checks campaign metadata exists ‚úì
   - Loads campaign context from Notion ‚úì

2. Launches 3 parallel sub-agents:

   Sub-Agent 1: Contact Enrichment
   - Uses music-campaign-contacts skill
   - Enriches contacts via Intel API
   - Returns: "47 contacts enriched (2 min 15s)"

   Sub-Agent 2: Email Generation
   - Uses music-campaign-email skill
   - Generates personalised templates via Anthropic API
   - Returns: "47 templates generated (1 min 45s)"

   Sub-Agent 3: Tracking Setup
   - Uses music-campaign-tracker skill
   - Configures Notion Campaign Tracking database
   - Returns: "Dashboard ready (45s)"

3. All sub-agents complete (2 min 15s total - parallel execution)

4. Aggregates results:
   - 47 contacts enriched (100% success)
   - 47 templates generated (100% British English)
   - Tracking dashboard: notion.so/summer-vibes-2025

Sequential time: ~5 minutes
Parallel time: ~2 minutes 15 seconds
Speedup: 2.2x faster ‚ö°
```

**Test 6b: Parallel vs Sequential Comparison**

**In Claude Code, ask:**
```
Why is the new music-promo-workflow faster than the old one?
```

**Expected Response:**
Should explain parallel execution:

```
OLD WORKFLOW (Sequential):
Contact enrichment (2 min 15s) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí wait
Email generation (1 min 45s)  ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí wait
Tracking setup (45s)          ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí wait
TOTAL: 4 minutes 45 seconds

NEW WORKFLOW (Parallel - Sub-Agents):
Contact enrichment (2 min 15s) ‚îê
Email generation (1 min 45s)   ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí All run simultaneously
Tracking setup (45s)           ‚îò
TOTAL: 2 minutes 15 seconds (longest sub-agent)

Speedup: 2.1x faster

Why parallel execution works:
- Contact enrichment doesn't depend on email generation
- Email generation doesn't depend on tracking setup
- All three tasks are independent
- Sub-agents (via Task tool) run in parallel automatically
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Skills Not Listed

**Symptom:** "What skills do I have?" doesn't show new skills

**Fix:**
1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Settings ‚Üí Capabilities ‚Üí Check skills are toggled ON
3. Restart Claude Desktop (‚åòQ and reopen)
4. Try again in Claude Code

---

### Issue 2: Skills Not Auto-Triggering

**Symptom:** Skills don't activate when expected

**Reason:** Skills activate based on context keywords (campaign, contacts, email, etc.)

**Test with explicit trigger:**
```
Using the music-campaign-validator skill, validate campaign name "Test-Campaign"
```

If this works, the skill is installed correctly. Auto-triggering will work when context matches.

---

### Issue 3: American Spelling in Examples

**Symptom:** Skill generates examples with American spelling

**Fix:**
Ask Claude Code to regenerate with explicit British English requirement:
```
Regenerate that example using ONLY British English spelling (colour, behaviour, favourite, etc.)
```

## üìä Performance Benchmarks

| Workflow | Before (Sequential) | After (Parallel) | Speedup |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|---------|
| music-promo-workflow create | ~5 minutes | ~2 min 15s | 2.2x faster |
| Contact enrichment (50 contacts) | 2 min 15s | 2 min 15s | Same (single task) |
| Email generation (50 templates) | 1 min 45s | 1 min 45s | Same (single task) |
| Full campaign setup | 5 min | 2 min 15s | 2.2x faster |

**Why the speedup?**
- Old workflow: Sequential (wait for each task)
- New workflow: Parallel sub-agents (all tasks simultaneously)
- Bottleneck: Longest sub-agent (contact enrichment at 2 min 15s)

---

## üéì Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Compositional Architecture

**Before:**
```
Command = Business logic + Orchestration (monolithic)
```

**After:**
```
Command = Orchestration only
Skills = Business logic (reusable)
Sub-Agents = Parallel execution (Task tool)
```

### 2. Skills for Composition

Each skill has single responsibility:
- `music-campaign-validator` - Validates campaign setup
- `music-campaign-contacts` - Enriches contacts
- `music-campaign-email` - Generates templates
- `music-campaign-tracker` - Tracks performance

All skills can be reused in other workflows!

### 3. Sub-Agents for Parallelisation

3 independent tasks run simultaneously:
```
<Task tool> Contact enrichment </Task>
<Task tool> Email generation </Task>
<Task tool> Tracking setup </Task>
```

Parent agent aggregates results when all complete.

### 4. MCP Integration

Skills integrate with MCPs:
- Intel API (contact enrichment)
- Anthropic API (email generation)
- Notion MCP (database storage)
- Puppeteer MCP (web scraping)
