# Phase 29 Pass 6 — Microcopy & UX Language Polish

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Date**: November 2025
**Scope**: Calm British indie tone, no hype, artist-first language

---

## 🎯 Tone Principles

### Core Philosophy

All user-facing text should feel like:
- **Calm email from a thoughtful producer friend** — not a sales pitch
- **Superhuman / Linear brevity** — short, clear, actionable
- **Ableton / Teenage Engineering energy** — playful but grounded in craft
- **British English throughout** — colour, organise, behaviour, programme

### Target Audience

- **Primary**: Independent artists & small teams
- **Secondary**: Small PR agencies (like Liberty Music PR)
- **NOT**: Corporate stakeholders, enterprise sales, growth hackers

### Voice Characteristics

✅ **Do this:**
- Calm, confident, non-hypey
- Concrete benefits over vague promises
- Helpful and clear
- Warm but not cringe
- Grounded in real music industry workflows

❌ **Avoid this:**
- "Crush your goals", "10x", "game-changing", "revolutionary"
- Buzzword soup ("synergy", "leverage", "ecosystem", "paradigm shift")
- Overly casual slang that will age badly
- Fake AI fluff ("our cutting-edge AI...")
- Hustle bro / growth-hack vibes

## 📝 Before/After Examples

### 1. Demo Selector Page

**Before:**
> "Choose your cinematic demo experience"

**After:**
> "Watch how indie artists and small teams use totalaud.io"

**Why**: "Cinematic demo experience" is marketing speak. The new version is clearer and audience-focused.

---

**Before:**
> "Follow Lana Glass through the complete creative workflow: from notebook sketches to AI-powered strategy, timeline planning, and strategic guidance."

**After:**
> "Follow Lana Glass from handwritten ideas to agent-suggested plans, timeline builds, and coach feedback."

**Why**: Removed "AI-powered" hype, replaced "strategic guidance" with concrete "coach feedback", made workflow steps clearer.

---

**Before:**
> "Imagine preparing an EP launch with Liberty Music PR. See how a UK indie campaign lives inside the OS constellation, with a preview of TAP integration."

**After:**
> "See how a UK indie campaign works with Liberty Music PR: from radio targets to press timeline to Total Audio Promo export."

**Why**: Removed "imagine" (vague), clarified "OS constellation", expanded TAP acronym, made benefits concrete.

---

**Before:**
> "Both demos feature hands-free auto-playback with Play/Pause/Skip controls."

**After:**
> "Both demos play automatically, step by step. Use Play/Pause/Skip to control playback."

**Why**: "Hands-free auto-playback" is jargon. New version is plain English.

---

### 2. DemoOverlay Controls

**Before:**
> "Begin Cinematic Playthrough"

**After:**
> "Play Demo"

**Why**: "Cinematic Playthrough" is unnecessarily fancy. "Play Demo" is clear and brief.

---

**Before:**
> "Demo Menu"

**After:**
> "Back to Demos"

**Why**: More specific about where button takes you.

---

**Before:**
> "{currentIndex} / {totalActions} actions"

**After:**
> "{currentIndex} / {totalActions} steps"

**Why**: "Steps" is friendlier than "actions" (which sounds technical/robotic).

---

### 3. ASCII Terminal

**Before:**
> "Compose your command..."

**After:**
> "Type a command..."

**Why**: "Compose" is slightly pretentious. "Type" is simple and direct.

---

**Before:**
> "> aud-os v2.0.0"

**After:**
> "> aud-os v2.0.0"

**Why**: Keep as-is — version numbers are fine for terminal aesthetic.

---

### 4. XP Agent Monitor

**Before:**
> "AGENT RUNS"

**After:**
> "AGENT RUNS"

**Why**: Keep as-is — all-caps header matches XP OS aesthetic.

---

**Before:**
> "✓ Complete"

**After:**
> "Complete"

**Why**: Keep checkmark but consider adding fallback text for accessibility.

---

**Before:**
> "⏳ Processing"

**After:**
> "Running..."

**Why**: "Running" is clearer and matches terminal language. Hourglass emoji stays for visual indicator.

---

### 5. LoopOS Timeline

**Before:**
> "Creative Timeline"

**After:**
> "Creative Timeline"

**Why**: Keep as-is — clear and descriptive.

---

**Before:**
> "Project Inspector"

**After:**
> "Project Details"

**Why**: "Inspector" sounds technical. "Details" is friendlier.

---

**Before:**
> "Timeline Overview"

**After:**
> "Overview"

**Why**: Redundant since it's clearly a timeline view. Shorter is better.

---

### 6. Aqua Coach Agent

**Before:**
> "Strategic guidance & creative direction"

**After:**
> "Get feedback on your plans and ideas"

**Why**: "Strategic guidance" is vague business speak. New version is concrete and artist-focused.

---

**Before:**
> "Hello! I'm your Coach agent. I can help you with:
> • Strategic planning for releases
> • Marketing and promotion guidance
> • Creative direction and positioning
> • Industry insights and best practices
> What would you like to explore today?"

**After:**
> "I'm Coach. I can help with:
> • Planning your release timeline
> • Promotion ideas for your music
> • Positioning your sound and story
> • Music industry advice
> Ask me anything."

**Why**: Removed "Hello!" (too chipper), shortened bullet points, replaced "strategic planning" with "planning your release timeline", "marketing and promotion guidance" with "promotion ideas for your music", removed "best practices" buzzword, replaced "What would you like to explore today?" with simpler "Ask me anything."

---

**Before:**
> "Coach is thinking..."

**After:**
> "Coach is writing..."

**Why**: "Writing" is more accurate (it's generating text) and less abstract than "thinking."

---

### 7. Analogue Creative Notebook (Artist)

**Before:**
> "Lana's handwritten concepts and midnight signals"

**After:**
> "Lana's notebook: ideas, aesthetics, and collaboration notes"

**Why**: "Midnight signals" is poetic but vague. New version is concrete and descriptive.

---

**Before:**
> "midnight signals — concept"

**After:**
> "midnight signals — EP concept"

**Why**: Clarify it's an EP, not just a vague concept.

---

### 8. Liberty Campaign Notebook

**Before:**
> "Liberty EP — release notes"

**After:**
> "Liberty EP — campaign plan"

**Why**: "Release notes" sounds like software changelog. "Campaign plan" is clearer.

---

**Before:**
> "UK indie release targeting student radio, BBC Introducing, and Spotify Editorial."

**After:**
> "UK indie release. Targets: student radio, BBC Introducing, Spotify Editorial."

**Why**: Removed "targeting" (business jargon), made structure clearer.

---

### 9. TAP Export Overlay

**Before:**
> "Exporting to Total Audio Promo"

**After:**
> "Exporting to Total Audio Promo..."

**Why**: Add ellipsis to show ongoing process.

---

**Before:**
> "This is a demo stub. Real TAP integration coming with Fusion Lite. Campaign data would sync to your Total Audio Promo dashboard for execution and reporting."

**After:**
> "Demo preview only. Full integration coming soon in Fusion Lite. Your campaign would sync to Total Audio Promo for tracking and reporting."

**Why**: Removed "stub" (developer jargon), simplified "execution and reporting" to "tracking and reporting", made tone friendlier.

---

### 10. Demo Step Descriptions

**Before:**
> "Running an AI agent to plan the EP announcement"

**After:**
> "Run an agent to suggest an EP announcement plan"

**Why**: Removed "AI" prefix (unnecessary), changed passive "to plan" to active "to suggest a plan."

---

**Before:**
> "Getting strategic guidance on the pitch"

**After:**
> "Ask Coach about pitching the EP"

**Why**: Removed "strategic guidance" buzzword, made action clearer.

---

**Before:**
> "The production workflow and collaboration lanes"

**After:**
> "Production timeline with collaboration lanes"

**Why**: "Workflow" is enterprise speak. "Timeline" is clearer and matches LoopOS interface.
