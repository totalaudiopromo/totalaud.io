# Archived Code (Pre-2025 Brand Pivot)

This directory contains legacy code from the previous iteration of totalaud.io before the 2025 brand pivot.

## What's Here

### `/app` - Archived Routes
- `/os` - The multi-OS theme system with 6 different "operating system" surfaces
- `/demo` - Demo pages for showcasing the old theme system
- `/dev` - Development and debugging pages
- `/console` - The legacy console/flow canvas interface
- `/epk` - Electronic press kit pages

### `/components` - Archived Components
- `/os` - OS launcher, navigation, and theme-specific containers
- `/companion` - AI companion chat interfaces
- `/rituals` - Daily ritual/habit tracking features
- `/projects` - Project management components
- `/persona` - User persona/profile features
- `/mood` - Mood tracking components
- `/narrative` - Story/narrative generation features
- `/demo` - Demo-specific components
- `/agents` - Agent node components (Intel, Pitch, Tracker)
- `/ambient` - Ambient sound/atmosphere engine
- `/features` - Flow canvas and node registry
- `/console` - Console dashboard components
- `/export` - Export functionality components
- `/ui` - Legacy UI components (CommandPalette, etc.)

## Why Archived

The 2025 brand pivot simplified totalaud.io to focus on:
- Simple artist onboarding (name + goal)
- Unified workspace with mode tabs (Scout, Ideas, Timeline, Pitch, Analytics)
- Clean, premium aesthetic without complex theming
- Mobile-first responsive design

The legacy code remains here for reference if any concepts need to be revisited.

## Restoring Code

If you need to restore any of this code:
1. Move the relevant directory back to `/src/app` or `/src/components`
2. Update any import paths as needed
3. Test thoroughly before deploying
