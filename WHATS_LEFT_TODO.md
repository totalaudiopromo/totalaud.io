---

#### 2. Extract Business Logic to Skills (2 hours)

**Value:** Prevents regressions, enforces standards

---

### Option 3: Complete the Vision (16 hours)
**Focus:** Implement all remaining items from original audit

## üí° My Recommendation

**Start with Option 1 (Fix Real Issues):**

1. **Fix TypeScript errors** (2 hours) - The sub-agent testing found real issues
   - Would you like me to help fix these tonight?
   - Or defer to next session?

**Then assess if you need Week 2/3 items:**
- accessibility-validator: Do you need WCAG enforcement?
- customer-acquisition-validator: Would this help focus?
- Other skills: Are they solving real problems you have?

**Remember:** You've already achieved the core goal:
- ‚úÖ Compositional architecture (12 skills)
- ‚úÖ Parallel execution (2.2x-3.6x speedup)
- ‚úÖ Automated quality (hooks)
- ‚úÖ 18 hours/month saved

The remaining items are **enhancements**, not **requirements**.

---

## ü§î Questions to Help Decide

1. **TypeScript errors:** Fix tonight or defer?
2. **Accessibility:** Do you need WCAG AA enforcement?
3. **Customer acquisition:** Would validator skill help focus?
4. **Old prompts:** Are any still useful, or can we archive them?
5. **Additional hooks:** Do you need pre-push validation?

**Answer these and I'll help prioritize what to implement next!**

**Status:** Week 1 complete, Week 2/3 optional enhancements  
**Decision needed:** What to implement next (if anything)
