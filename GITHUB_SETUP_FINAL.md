## ⏸️ 2 Quick Actions Needed (2 minutes)

### 1. Approve & Merge CODEOWNERS PRs

Both repos just need the CODEOWNERS file merged:

**totalaud.io - PR #4**:
- 🔗 https://github.com/totalaudiopromo/totalaud.io/pull/4
- Click "Files changed" to review (just 1 line: `* @totalaudiopromo`)
- Click "Approve" or use admin override
- Click "Squash and merge"

**total-audio-platform - PR #4**:
- 🔗 https://github.com/totalaudiopromo/total-audio-platform/pull/4
- Click "Files changed" to review (just 1 line: `* @totalaudiopromo`)
- Click "Approve" or use admin override
- Click "Squash and merge"

---

## 🎯 Optional: Repository Settings (Web UI Only)

These settings can only be changed via the GitHub web interface (no API access):

### For Both Repos:

**Auto-delete branches** (recommended):
- Settings → General → Pull Requests
- ✅ Check "Automatically delete head branches"

**Merge strategy** (recommended):
- Same page, "Pull Requests" section
- ❌ Uncheck "Allow merge commits"
- ✅ Ensure "Allow squash merging" is checked

**Branch protection** (may already be active):
- Settings → Branches
- Add/edit rule for `main`:
  - ✅ Require PR before merging (1 approval)
  - ✅ Require status checks to pass
  - ✅ Require branches to be up to date
  - ✅ Include administrators
